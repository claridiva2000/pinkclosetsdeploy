    <p>There is more to de-cluttering and organizing than meets the eye. The objects in your home can represent a memory or emotion. Over time those objects can pile up, bringing chaos to the sactuary that is your home. We understand that this can be an emotional process and specialize in helping clients who have difficulty "letting go".</p>
    <p>But trust us, it's worth it!</p>
    <p>The time saved from knowing EXACTLY where everything is adds hours back into your week which adds up to years added back to your life that you can spend on yourself or your family. And the stress relief of coming home to a beautiful and orderly home will have an amazing effect on your mood and even your health!</p>
